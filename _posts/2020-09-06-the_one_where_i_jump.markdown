The idea of entering the software engineering world would NEVER have occurred to me ten years ago. At that time I was preoccupied with earning a Bachelor's degree in Psychology (later to be a Masters in Clinical Psychology) and enlisting in the Air National Guard. These were all safe choices, guaranteeing I'd land a job and if not, there's always the military to fall back on. So what would influence me to completely change a career I had invested more than ten years to pursue?

The answer isn't actually as dramatic for an enticing story but is one of the most difficult and best decisions I made for myself. It would be helpful to understand some background information: that people often describe me as quite analytic, logical, and tedious. I can spend hours editing videos, learning how to create a writing graphic I'd like to implement, how to build a website for my wife's holistic nutrition business (still a work in progress!), or carving intricate patterns on pumpkins. I began to notice I found enjoyment in building that website with no clue what I was doing, even when I ran into more issues than I'd like to admit.  

I began entertaining the idea of coding after hearing about a friend who quit his job as a math teacher and became a software engineer through an eight-week coding bootcamp. I thought, "Hey, I'd like to quit my job and I've always loved working with computers." I'd just been activated for a three year tour after quitting my job as a outpatient psychotherapist. While I was and continue to be passionate about psychology, the grey areas of how to approach my cases were not mixing well with my inherent traits. Instead of looking at those traits as difficult or worth other people's judgments, I decided to find a way to embrace them. Rather than spend my life doing a job, I started asking myself how could I build a career around those strong suits so that I might enjoy the work I do. How could I build the life I wanted?  Could working remote be a possibility while living in the tiny house I wished to build (a future goal)? Did a career like that even exist?

Cue two years researching software development, taking free courses, and searching online school options. My analytical and logical self wanted to cover all the bases to ensure I actually enjoyed coding so that I felt I was making a safe/smart choice. Eventually, I began to realize that no amount of extra research at this point was going to help solidify my decision and that deep down I had already made a choice. I was making what seemed like the most un-analytical and illogical decision based in so much uncertainty; and then I decided to finally jump. In a way what seemed unsafe and uncertain became one of the most logical decisions I've made.
